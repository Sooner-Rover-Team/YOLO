# YOLO

The Sooner Rover Team (kinda) maintains a fork of the [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/) project. It allows for additional low-level object detection using YOLO, an [object detection system](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).

## Installation

(currently untested!!! 6/24/2023)

Please follow the instructions found in the [Darknet installation documentation](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/install/). Please keep in mind that the `CUDA` "fancy GPU" section requires an NVIDIA GPU for local testing. Otherwise, you should use the CPU/`opencv` implementation.

## Documentation

This SoRo component is a new candidate for documentation! If you know markdown, and have a good idea about what's going on here, please feel free to [make a new page about it in the docs](https://sooner-rover-team.github.io/soro-documentation/html/new-page-guide.html)! :)
